# Julis ❤
My Discord bot. Made using Node.js, with love ❤.
The eslint configuration assumes you to be on a wide screen.
If your screen size is smaller, you may change the settings - _especially_ the "max-len" setting.
I have tried to personify the bot.
So, I may refer to the _bot_ as "she", or as a **human** further in this project.
Thank you.

Code coming soon...

I will be uploading the code in such a way that the parts which are used everywhere are uploaded first.

## Firestore DB Setup
+ The **FSPID** is your _Firestore Project ID_, **FSCEmail** is your _Firestore Client Email_ and **FSPKey** is your _Firestore Private Key_.
+ These credentials can be downloaded in a JSON format from your firebase console. [Instructions coming later]
