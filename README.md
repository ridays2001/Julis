# Julis ❤
My Discord bot. Made using Node.js, with ❤.
<div style='text-align:justify'>
	The eslint configuration assumes you to be on a wide screen.
	If your screen size is smaller, you may change the settings - <em>especially</em> the "max-len" setting.
	I have tried to personify the bot.
	So, I may refer to the <em>bot</em> as "she", or as a <strong>human</strong> further in this project.
	<br>
	Thank you.
</div>

Code coming soon...

I will be uploading the code in such a way that the parts which are used everywhere are uploaded first.

## Firestore DB Setup
+ The **FSPID** is your _Firestore Project ID_, **FSCEmail** is your _Firestore Client Email_ and **FSPKey** is your _Firestore Private Key_.
+ These credentials can be downloaded in a JSON format from your firebase console. [Instructions coming later]
